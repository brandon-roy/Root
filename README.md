<h1>Background</h1>
<p>
    Grapevine fanleaf virus (GFLV) is among the most damaging viral pathogens of grapevines globally, yet its impact on root system architecture (RSA) has remained unexplored. RSA, critical for nutrient uptake, water absorption, and stress tolerance, can be substantially altered by viruses to enhance their vector-based transmission. GFLV encodes the multifunctional protein 1E<sup>Pol*/Sd</sup>, which contains a symptom determinant at amino acid position 802; intriguingly, a single amino acid substitution at this position significantly modifies both leaf and root phenotypes in <em>Nicotiana benthamiana</em>. Infection with wildtype GFLV harboring lysine at position 802 resulted in fewer root tips, thicker root diameters, and reduced branching frequency compared to controls, accompanied by substantial transcriptomic alterations involving reactive oxygen species (ROS), hormone signaling, and immune response pathways. Understanding how a single viral amino acid can reshape RSA deepens our knowledge of virus-host interactions and could influence GFLV transmission dynamics by its soil-borne nematode vector, <em>Xiphinema index</em>.

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>
    <em>Nicotiana benthamiana</em> plants were mechanically inoculated with two wildtype GFLV strains (GHu and F13) and two mutants (GHu 1E<sup>Pol*/Sd</sup><sub>K802G</sub> and F13 1E<sup>Pol*/Sd</sup><sub>G802K</sub>). Infection was verified using RT-PCR and DAS-ELISA assays. Roots were excavated at 4, 17, and 26 days post-inoculation (dpi), and images were captured using a flatbed scanner. RSA traits were analyzed using RhizoVision Explorer. RNA was extracted from root tissues for 3' RNA-Seq, followed by differential gene expression and gene ontology enrichment analysis. </p>
        <p>The pipeline to analyze the enrichment data is represented by this repository. The necessary scripts to conduct appropriate data processing, statistical analysis, and to generate figures for this manuscript are similarly present.  
</p>

<h2>Results</h2>
<p>
    Significant RSA changes were most pronounced at 17 dpi in plants infected with wildtype GHu and mutant F13 1E<sup>Pol*/Sd</sup><sub>G802K</sub>, both containing lysine at amino acid position 802. These plants exhibited fewer root tips, thicker root diameters, and reduced branching frequencies.
</p>

<p>
    Reactive oxygen species (ROS) were prominently detected in root pericycle tissues at 7 dpi in plants infected with strains containing lysine at position 802, coinciding with the expression of above-ground symptoms.
</p>

<p>
    Transcriptomic analysis revealed significant dysregulation in genes involved in immune response, hormone signaling, and oxidative stress pathways, particularly at 17 dpi.
